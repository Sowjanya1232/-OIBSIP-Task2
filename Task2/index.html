        <h3><span class="n">"AVUL PAKIR JAINULABDEEN ABDUL KALAM " </span> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island in Tamil Nadu.
            His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.
            After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University 
            of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior 
            class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, 
            impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline". He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, 
            as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

            "Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999)". Among his numerous awards were two of the countryâ€™s highest honours, <span class="a">"the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997)"</span>.
